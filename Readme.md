# Milestone-6: Hackers read news too you know

## Learning Competencies

At the end of this milestone you will learn

- Reading and understanding code
- Backend vs Frontend
- Building dynamic webapps using Express
- Understanding the databases: Mongodb

## Problem Statement:

Woohoo! Look like we're doing some real web app development now. Isn't this a lot more fun!? Working with actual pages and interactivity and users and profiles and databases and bugs and errors and crashes (OK! Maybe the last 3 aren't that fun).
